# Supplements
A directory containing tables/responses for published works
Please feel free to let me know if you want to know more

1. Yao et al., SRL, 2021

It includes the latest reponse letter (after several rounds of revision between the editor and myself); 
a few tables, and the supplementary figures 

2. Yao et al., JGR, 2020

Supplementary figures, and tables (Detected Catalog; relocated catalog, and stress drop pairs)

3. Yao et al., EPSL, 2021

Similar content. The initial submission was rejected, and I re-process the data (the results hold robust).
I am interested in more insights in better understanding the interaction between large earthquakes (dynamic
stress perturbation), slow slip events, and associated micro-seismicity 

4. Yao et al., JGR, 2017

It contains a few tables, relocated aftershocks (mainly), detected earthquakes, repeating aftershocks. 
Just to remind myself that: using repeating families of longer durations could provide insights into the fault
healing after the megathrust (see Chaves et al., 2020, SciAdv). 

5. Yao et al., GJI, 2015

As my first project as a PhD at Georgia Tech, the work is even not close to "good" from the point of my view nowadays. 
I missed so many details, and it would be great if I can could one day re-analyze the dataset and write another paper. 

Machine learning might be a reasonable tool. Will keep this in mind.
