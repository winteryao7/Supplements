# Supplements
A directory containing tables/responses for published works
Please feel free to let me know if you want to know more

1. Yao et al., SRL, 2021

It includes the latest reponse letter (after several rounds of revision between the editor and myself); 
a few tables, and the supplementary figures 

2. Yao et al., JGR, 2020

Supplementary figures, and tables (Detected Catalog; relocated catalog, and stress drop pairs)

3. Yao et al., EPSL, 2021

Similar content. The initial submission was rejected, and I re-process the data (the results hold robust)
I am interested in more insights in better understanding the interaction between large earthquakes (dynamic
stress perturbation), slow slip events, and associated micro-seismicity
